{"name":"Sequence Matrix","tagline":"Assemble multigene/multitaxon phylogenetic datasets easily","body":"Sequence Matrix allows you to easily concatenate gene datasets. A spreadsheet-like interface displays what you've assembled so far; TNT, Nexus, FASTA and Mega files can be dragged into the application to add them. Your entire dataset can be exported as TNT or Nexus files.\r\n\r\nTo find out more, please see our [introductory screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adwr-CZdNOM) of Sequence Matrix on YouTube. We've also [made available a presentation on Sequence Matrix](http://www.slideshare.net/mrvaidya/sequence-matrix-gene-concatenation-made-easy-4797559) (delivered to the Hennig XXVIII conference in June 2009) and [the paper we wrote](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2010.00329.x) describing Sequence Matrix in Cladistics. \r\n\r\n# For users of MacOS X 10.10 (Yosemite)\r\n\r\nThe latest MacOS X version of Sequence Matrix available on this website will not work on MacOS X 10.10 or above. I've created a release of Sequence Matrix 1.7.8 using [packr](https://github.com/libgdx/packr) which appears to work on newer releases of MacOS X which is [available for download](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B_F6LJAWh8sieHVlMjAxWW9qVnM&export=download) from Google Docs.\r\n\r\nIf you get an \"unidentified developer\" error, please right-click on the file and select \"Open\": you should get the some error, but with an \"Open\" button that allows you to bypass it. Alternatively, you can change your security settings: go to System Preferences on your Mac, click on \"Security & Privacy\" and go to the \"General\" tab. If you set \"All apps downloaded from:\" to \"Anywhere\", Sequence Matrix should run without any problem.\r\n\r\n# Testimonials\r\n\r\nHere are some reviews of Sequence Matrix we've spotted around the internet.\r\n\r\n * \"Thanks so much. This software has saved me many﻿ hours of tedious work.\" -- [evanmelstad](http://www.youtube.com/user/evanmelstad) on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/comment?lc=bOaM8sE6UvMNa2ZilLgH45-Uti1e3fwDMQ2dXEtzNXQ).\r\n\r\n * \"It is a real pain combining matrices from different loci, particularly when you have taxa represented in one matrix and not in another. I’ve usually done this by hand and it gets tedious. I recently stumbled across a Java tool that makes this process quite simple: SequenceMatrix.\" -- [The Glor Lab](http://lacertilia.com/?p=1420), University of Rochester. \r\n\r\n    \"... the 12 individual gene alignments were concatenated using the software SequenceMatrix v1.7.6 (Vaidya et al., 2011) to create a master alignment of 10,836 bp total, equivalent to roughly 65% of the mtDNA genome.\" -- ''[Pleistocene diversification of living squirrel monkeys (Saimiri spp.) inferred from complete mitochondrial genome sequences](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.03.025)'' by Kenneth L. Chioua, Luca Pozzia, Jessica W. Lynch Alfaroc and Anthony Di Fiore. \r\n\r\n# Problems?
