/**
 * A FormatHandlerEvent stores information about the state of the FormatHandler when
 * the event was fired - which file it was processing, which line it was on, which
 * formatHandler object was being used - as well as what actually happened.
 *
 * This could get complicated, and I desperately wish there was an easier way to
 * handle this madness. Any ideas? Anybody?
