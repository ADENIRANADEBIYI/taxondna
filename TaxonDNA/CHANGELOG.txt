CHANGELOG for TaxonDNA

From 0.9.4 to 0.9.5
===================
Notes
	*	The reported 'actual length' now ignores missing
		information ENTIRELY. So a sequence with 30bp of
		'?' in the middle will be reported as being 30bp
		smaller than it really is. This makes sense to ME,
		let me know if it doesn't make sense to you.
	*	From this release, I'm changing the version number
		format; pre-releases will be marked 'a', so I'm
		currently working on 0.9.4a. This will be changed
		to 'b' once features are fixed, and 0.9.5 once it's
		all done. For convenience sake, the Help->About
		will NOT change to 'b' or later; it will go from
		0.9.4a to 0.9.5
	*	At the same time, the versions IN TaxonDNA will
		increment along with release 0.9.4.1, .2, etc.
		This can go on FOREVER (i.e. expect 0.9.4.9999, etc.)
		but will be reset to 0.9.5 at release.
		Changelogs will reflect ONLY FULL VERSION CHANGES.
		This makes things easier for me.
	*	Nobody noticed this, but BlockAnalysis should have
		stopped working because of the SpeciesSummary 
		changes. I've fixed this now, BUT BlockAnalysis
		might be calculating it's values slightly differently
		(and more accurately) now. If it's true, success rates
		will be HIGHER than before. Let me know if you need
		this investigated.
	*	The same applies to Cluster. Basically, we were using
		the sequence count for each species to determine if
		all sequences had been collected together in Cluster (or
		were coming out together in BlockAnalysis). We are now
		using the count of sequences with valid matches ONLY.
		So, we should be getting more 'successful' matches.

Major changes
	*	Randomization is finally done! (It's called "Randomizer")
	*	The GenBank file reader now uses 'CDS' instead of
		'gene' to filter for certain CDS features. There is
		also a new option to decided whether you want to keep
		sequences which don't match the selected CDSs, or
		remove them from the file.
	*	Many changes to the build.xml file. Everything will
		keep working, but I've moved a lot of repetitive stuff
		(such as generating source files for backup) into this.
		Scratching an itch, etc.
	*	Planning.xml is now 'deprecated'; we're now using a new
		text format to store tickets. It's a temporary solution,
		but we've got a website on this site which makes it's
		easy to work with; this might change later. Still,
		it's a simple format, and it won't be too hard to
		convert it about any.

Warnings
Bugs fixed
	*	The GenBank loader would have problems with files where
		there is a line starting with '/' just before the
		'ORIGIN' bit starts. Don't ask. Fixed (ticket #32)
	*	The GenBank loader would also get confused in any
		situation where a line in the FEATURES section began
		without a '/' (which it assumed meant that it was a
		new feature entry). This could disrupt the state machine
		from distinguishing CDS entries from non-CDS entries.
		Fixed (ticket #33)
	*	The Sequence name determiner earlier wasn't matching
		for the end of the word, so it could make strange
		partial matches (i.e. "Mito and tRNA" matched as 'Mita and
		(t)'"). This is hopefully fixed now, although at the expense
		of more false 'warning' sequences. (sourceforge #1491379)
	*	You can now cancel SpeciesSummary =).
	*	Tiny but critical bug in CompleteOverlap fixed.

Tested
Interesting
	*	We can generate javadocs now (use 'ant javadocs')
	*	We can (experimentally) publish to Sourceforge without issues.

From 0.9.3 to 0.9.4
===================
Note
	*	I used to think that GI numbers would be uniformly
		independent. This is only true as long as you are using
		data from ONE DATABASE ONLY. i.e. The GI number which
		DDBJ gives you *might* be the same as one in the
		GenBank. As long as your datasets are all from the
		same system, you *should* be okay.

Major changes
	* 	Please see the first bug fixed - it's a major one.
		Please check all your generated pairwise distances,
		and let me know if it has large effects.
	*	MAJOR changes in the SpeciesSummary code. It has been
		rewritten and moved around a LOT, so there might be
		bugs. I'll try to test it out, but mostly I'm just
		going to be seeing if I get the same results from
		0.9.4 as we got in previous versions. So - be careful!
	*	More menu accelerators For Greater Justice.
	*	The Exporter can now output a species matrix (a character
		matrix encoding species information, etc.). This is not
		all that well tested, so let me know if you find bugs.
	*	Species summary now calculates species-with-multiple-sequences
		lists in new ways. This shouldn't affect anything (much),
		but it might.
	*	A prototypical GenBank file reader. Note that thus far, we
		can only READ GenBank files, not write them. Sorry. Also,
		there might be bugs. This is very much a PROTOTYPE and
		EXPERIMENTAL. Careful, gov'ner.
	*	The Randomizer - allows you to randomize one dataset "down"
		to another one to remove sequences-per-species biases.
		Not Finished Yet.

Warnings
	*	Major bug with calculating pairwise distances fixed 
		in this release; please check all previously calculated 
		values.
	*	The "insert headers" option in Exporter is *experimental*,
		and has been very inadequately tested. Do NOT trust it!

Bugs fixed
	*	A rather major bug in Sequence handling and pairwise
		distribution counting was fixed. Internal gaps were
		being matched against external gaps. THIS WILL AFFECT
		PAIRWISE DISTANCES, as they use getSharedLength() to
		calculate the p distance.
	*	Lots of little fixes.

Tested
	*	If you try to load a file into TaxonDNA *greater* than the
		Java maximum memory limitation, the loading will silently
		fail (no errors), but TaxonDNA will keep running.

Interesting
	*	

From 0.9.2 to 0.9.3
===================
Major changes
	* 	Added a new feature to the SequencePanel to "Sort by family" which means the 
		code is in SequenceList, like all the other sorts)
	*	Added a new module "Exporter" which can export files in custom
		formats as per instructions. It can also do multiple export by
		family names, which will be extended to other multiple
		exports.
	*	Added a new module "Complete Overlap", which determines the
		areas of complete available.
	*	New keyboard shortcuts - Ctrl-T runs the complete test suite,
		Ctrl-E goes to the custom export module.

Bugs fixed
	*	FastaFile can now handle empty lines in files.
	*	no_allo_match is not a separate category in BestMatch and BlockAnalysis
	*	BestMatch/BlockAnalysis ignores non-allo matches during
		counting (dupe of above)

Interesting
	*	OMFG Vim knows what a changelog file is. Blown away.

From 0.9.1.2 to 0.9.2
=====================
 	- SequencePanel now imposes a limit of 30 characters on the species name
		(not counting the gi/size variables)
	- You can now export all intra and inter-specific distances from the
		PairwiseSummary.
	- BarcodeGenerator now saves the barcodes as FASTA files, not Mega.
	- SpeciesSummary now displays all sequence GIs for each species name.
	- Put in a proper naming system (all classes are now in com.ggvaidya.TaxonDNA...)
		Thank you Eclipse refactoring!
 
BUGS FIXED:
	- Discovered: Strange formatting behavior - if you resize a FormLayout-ed
		Panel, objects which don't fit will just vanish.
	- Fixed: Percentages in BestMatch don't add up to a 100%
	- Fixed: "Missing" sequences spat out by AlignmentHelperPlugin can't be saved
	- Fixed: BestMatch matches a sequence to itself if the best conspecific match is as good as the sequence itself
	- Tested: Pairwise distribution and overlap - a 326 dataset was run, and the
		exported values from PairwiseSummary were used to run binning, determine
		overlap, and determine the number of distances which ought to be calculated.
		All values were identical to the values reported by TaxonDNA.

From 0.9.1.1 to 0.9.1.2
=======================
	- Added code to display GI numbers for the program.
	- Actually added the CHANGELOG into CVS
	- Partial command line interface (coded into TaxonDNA/CommandLine.java)
		If there are any command line options, TaxonDNA will hand
		over complete control to CommandLine. CommandLine might then
		create new TaxonDNA objects as it sees fit.
	- A PROPER Testing harness. Test code is integrated in the object itself,
		and a module (Tester) runs them all through. The 'Test' directory
		contains test files used to test I/O. Otherwise, everything is in
		Tester.	Currently, only three classes are actually Testable.
	- build.xml now builds into a 'build' directly, making everything much cleaner.
	- build.xml now has a 'clean' target. Yay!
	- ProgressDialog now has a FLAG_NOCANCEL, which causes the Cancel button to not
		be displayed.
	- Rearranged TaxonDNA modules so that the order makes more sense.

BUGS FIXED:
	- FIXED. A bug in Sequence which caused it to barf on empty sequences (e.g. '---').
	- FIXED. Sequence has been modified to note Uracils as 'not DNA' rather than 'illegal'.
	- DISCOVERED. Comments do not work correctly in Mega files.
	- DISCOVERED. A rather subtle but non-serious bug which removes the last space from sequence names in Mega files.
	- DISCOVERED. TaxonDNA has no major problems with overlap restrictions.

From 0.9.1 to 0.9.1.1
======================
	(incomplete)
	- Some changes to the documentation files (HowTo protocol.rtf)
	- FIXED. build.xml was storing EVERY .class file into TaxoNDNA.jar.
	- REWRITTEN. DNA/PairwiseDistribution.java, because the old version
	  was rather odd and somewhat crufty. The new version will take the
	  same time to run (or be even slower), but the code is much cleaner.
