>>[1] Multiple "CODONPOSSETs" may be contradictory; we should only read the first one.

Ideally, the first one.

Unfortunately, our code is bizarre, and might require the 0/1/2/3 positions to be in order. This would be a bigger issue. It should all be fixed, of course.

See branch prevent-multiple-codonpossets to see how.

>>[2] Nexus sequence names should allow for '(' characters

Unfortunately, Nexus file import is crazy. So there's not an awful lot we can do about that.

>>[3] "Export -> One file per column" should use the last used directory name, not one level up
Which it only uses because it's descended from the advanced Nexus export, which does this.

>>[4] "Export -> One file per column" fails when two columns have the same name, or they have different names on a case-insensitive operating system (like most of them).
